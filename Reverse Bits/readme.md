# Problem  
>Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.  

>For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).  

# Solution  

1.The conversion between decimal and binary is based on n%2.

2.If we save the result of modding in sequence,it is the reversion of binary value.  

3.Convert the sequence to be decimal value.
